To perform an operation, such as 'delete all files except **.jpg and**.jpeg in a directory, and copy all those jpg/jpeg files into another directory', you'll have to either write a native program or a shell script. There are some disadvantages though: native program is lack of flexibility (you have to compile it again to enable new features), and shell script cannot run both on Windows and Linux. So this script language (PHP) based project enables you to do this sort of things in PHP. An architecture is ready, all you have to do is pick up functions to apply on files in a directory, or, if the function you want doesn't exist, you can write one under the architecture. It won't do any good to non-programmers, but it does help a lot for programmers hopefully.
